# PFRPG Maladies Library 
One of the top requests for my [Disease Tracker](https://github.com/bmos/FG-PFRPG-Disease-Tracker) was a way to have diseases pre-entered to keep game speed up. As of v1.5.0, [Disease Tracker](https://github.com/bmos/FG-PFRPG-Disease-Tracker) now supports modules of diseases and poisons. Along with support for other modules, I am releasing this module, which contains all Paizo-official PF1e content that I am allowed to include. Without [Disease Tracker](https://github.com/bmos/FG-PFRPG-Disease-Tracker), this module will not show up anywhere but in the module load screen.
